TOM or The Online Machine is a python RAD fraemwork for rich client/server applications.  It is pure python (exceot for QT) and plugin based on both client and server.

TOM leverages some other projects with my thanks:  

[rpyc](https://github.com/tomerfiliba-org/rpyc) is used for client/server communication

[lmdb](https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/en/release/) is used by the default data store plugin

[PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/) is used for the client interface.

More documentation to follow
